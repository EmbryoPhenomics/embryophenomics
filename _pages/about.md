## What? 
EmbryoPhenomics is a research group at the University of Plymouth developing the next generation of technologies for capturing the dynamic process of embryonic development in aquatic animals. We curate and apply new technology to some of the most pressing challenges in biology. 

## Who?
The EmbryoPhenomics research group is a diverse group of researchers at various stages of their career - from undergraduate to professor. The group was established in 2018 by Dr Tills and stemmed from the increasing application of new technological approaches to studying the process of development. Find out what drives us and meet the scientists behind the research

## Why?
Biology is amazingly complex and this is most apparent during early development - when animals change spatially and functionally at different temporal scales. Phenomics is the use of high-dimensional-organismal-screening to capture this complexity and it represents a step-change in the way in which we are able to understand how animals work.

## How?
The morphology, physiology and behaviour of embryos change on a minute by minute, hour by hour and day by day basis. Capturing this dynamic process presents a formidable challenge to scientists. We are responding to this challenge by building a range of automated high-throughput phenomic technologies that enable us to monitor the development of aquatic animals both in the laboratory, but also out in the natural environment.



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
