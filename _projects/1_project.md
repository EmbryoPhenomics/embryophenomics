The brief: repeated observations of embryos distributed across a multiwell plate - simple!

The LabEmbryoCam - at its core, addresses this via economical optics, motion systems, and compute platform - in a small, modular footprint.

The LabEmbryoCam project has origins > 15 years ago when Oli was assembling off the shelf high-end components in new ways, controlled via MicroManager - an ImageJ plugin, to achieve this goal.

Fast forward to 2025 and we are manufacturing the LabEmbryoCam - in house, aided by 3D printing. 

The LabEmbryoCam includes a custom user interface, and strikes a great balance between quality of video, and size constraints.

Gone are the days of needing to reduce the size of an experiment to fit the size of your available harddrives.

For more details, checkout the 2024 paper in our published work, or our Github repository.

If you are interested in the LabEmbryoCam for your own research, it is an opensource technology. However, if you would rather have us build one for you - we also have you covered.
